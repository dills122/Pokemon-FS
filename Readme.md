# Pokemon : File System Edition

Welcome to NTFS, an uncharted area in the Pokémon universe, where nothing is like you know. NTFS is a virtual Pokémon world full of adventures throughout your file system. Explore directories in search of that rare pokemon and have a hell of a lot of fun along the way.

## Getting Started (Dev)

To install and run the development edition you need to install this app globally.

``` bash
npm install -g {workingDir}\Catch-Em-All
```

## Searching

Currently the only command supported is `search`, which doesn't do much yet... However, stay tuned for future improvements and maybe an actual game.
