# Pokemon : File System Edition

Welcome to NTFS, an uncharted area in the Pokémon universe, where nothing is like you know. NTFS is a virtual Pokémon world full of adventures throughout your file system. Explore directories in search of that rare pokemon and have a hell of a lot of fun along the way.

## Getting Started (Dev)

To install and run the development edition you need to install this app globally.

``` bash
npm install -g {workingDir}\Catch-Em-All
```

## Searching

Currently the only command supported is `search`, which allows you to attempt to catch pokemon and add them to your inventory. Right now the catching randomness isn't good and catch rate is 80% or greater.

Remove the dust from those unseen folders and catch a pokemon.
